              There are many schools operating in every city in the country. All
              schools declare themselves as the number one school in the city
              and district, and continue to do so. Despite the lack of seating
              arrangements in classrooms, admissions are ongoing under the
              adjust culture. A learned teacher can only manage large groups of
              a hundred or two hundred students. This does not bring about the
              desired qualitative and positive change in the student's behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              In such a situation, the "Dhruv Foundation Trust" has started a
              mission to innovate in the field of education by operating
              twenty-seater schools. Under this mission, schools are envisioned
              where each section of a class will only have 20 students.
              Consequently, a teacher can provide the prescribed subject matter
              well in their class, and students can comprehend the given
              knowledge effectively. The foundation is working to prepare a team
              that can give wings to this mission. In the future, the mission is
              planned to be expanded through franchise branches not only in
              Dholpur city but also in other cities of Rajasthan. We are
              committed to starting a new initiative in the field of education
              by providing our curriculum material and other child-centric
              educational content and material to Twenty Seater Schools (Top N'
              Town).
            </p>
            <p>
              As the first step, we have started with the "Top N' Town 20-20
              School" in Hundawal Nagar Phase 2, Dholpur city. In 2018, Dhruv
              Foundation began an English medium school from Play Group to Class
              8 for elementary education. Although the pace slowed down due to
              the Corona pandemic in 2019, positive results are now gradually
              starting to appear.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's move forward together and dedicate our contribution to the
              nation through education.
